 *  FactoMES is built to track everything from raw materials to products, and everything in between. This provides you with insight and understanding of what is happening on your factory floor -->
## What is MES
MES stands for Manufacturing Execution System, which is a software solution that provides real-time data and control of production processes in a manufacturing plant. The main purpose of an MES system is to bridge the gap between the management level systems, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, and the operational level systems, such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, in a manufacturing environment.
MES systems provide detailed information on production processes, including order tracking, resource utilization, production scheduling, and quality control, among other things. This information can be used to optimize production processes and make informed decisions about production planning and control.
MES systems can also interface with other systems and equipment, such as machines and sensors, to automate production processes and improve efficiency. The integration of MES systems with other systems can provide a comprehensive view of the production process, from the receipt of raw materials to the delivery of finished goods, and support effective decision making.
Overall, MES systems play a crucial role in modern manufacturing operations by providing real-time data and control to optimize production processes and improve the efficiency of production operations.

## Who can benefit from MES
There are several groups of people and organizations who can benefit from using Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES):
1.	Manufacturers: MES systems can provide real-time data and control of production processes, helping manufacturers optimize their production operations and improve efficiency. This can result in lower costs, increased production yields, and improved product quality.
2.	Operations and Production Managers: MES systems provide detailed information on production processes, allowing operations and production managers to monitor production operations and make informed decisions about production planning and control.
3.	Quality Assurance Teams: MES systems can help quality assurance teams monitor production processes to ensure that products are manufactured to meet quality standards. They can also provide information about product defects, helping to identify and address quality issues.
4.	Supply Chain Managers: MES systems can provide information about the status of production processes and inventory levels, allowing supply chain managers to better manage their supply chain and make informed decisions about production planning and control.
5.	IT Teams: MES systems can be integrated with other systems and equipment, allowing IT teams to automate production processes and improve efficiency.
Overall, MES systems can provide valuable information and control for a wide range of people and organizations involved in the manufacturing process, helping to optimize production operations and improve efficiency.
